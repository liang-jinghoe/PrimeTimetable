### Prime Timetable
A website that allows students to arrange their timetable. This website serves as a middle man by connecting to the actual website of an universiti to gain access to the list of courses available to bid.

### Why this system existed
The website provided by the universiti lacks interfaces for students to arrange their timetable. Therefore this website will retrieves the slots available from the universiti website and re-render them using graphics to provide students better visual aids for arranging their timetable.

This system currently available for students from:
- Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman
